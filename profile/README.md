### 🔎 Overview
* EigenDB is a light-weight in-memory vector database written in Go. It’s entirely open-source! ❤️
* Employs the _Hierarchical Navigable Small World_ (HNSW) algorithm to perform similarity search with the highest level of efficiency and speed.⚡
    * Logic surrounding the HNSW algorithm is handled by our open-source Go library, [_hnswgo_](https://github.com/Eigen-DB/hnswgo)! 🧠
* Basic database operations can be performed seamlessly through EigenDB's very simple [REST API](https://eigendb.mintlify.app/api-reference/api)! ✨
